## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the flexbox, but i have to learn much more yet about this.

### Continued development

I'm going to study a lot more javascript and add typescript to my studies, flexbox and grid-layout. I'm going to focus part of my learning on the frontend, but my goal is the backend.
